            <p id="sign">The term "<i>Plunderphonics"</i> was coined by composer John Oswald in 1985 in his essay <a href="https://www.plunderphonics.com/xhtml/xplunder.html" target="_blank">"Plunderphonics, or Audio Piracy as a Compositional Prerogative"</a>, and eventually explicitly defined in the liner notes of his <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grayfolded" target="_blank">Grayfolded</a> album.</p> In the present, the ideas originally presented by John Oswald have spread far to create lauded albums, impacting generations and birthing genres. These works are controversial, often resulting in legal issues regarding sample clearance and philoshopical arguments regarding fair-use. 
            <br>
            <p>The genres of Hip-Hop, House, French House, Electronica, and Jungle are a few examples of genres owing heavily to musical sampling.</p>
                   
            <h2>Controversy</h2>
            <h3>Legal Issues</h3>
                <p>In the 80's sampling was a new idea. Rap group <a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/De_La_Soul" target="_blank">De La Soul</a> created an album called 3 Feet and Rising. They sampled a british rock group named <a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Turtles" target="_blank">The Turtles.</a> The Turtles promptly sued, and collected, a value of <a href="https://www.briffa.com/blog/classic-copyright-cases-de-la-soul/" target="_blank">1.7 million dollars. </a> This set a precedent for artists making use of sampling. Creativity now had to become secondary to legal fear; it was now proven that artists could pay upwards of millions for posting uncleared samples, their careers were at risk of beiing financially ruined and albums being pulled from shelves. </p>
