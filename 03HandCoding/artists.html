            <h1>Sample Based Works</h1>
            <p>The interesting philoshopical and legal implications of sample-based music should not detract from the genuine beauty created as a result of it. Below are a list of lauded albums and artists created atleast in part, often totally, with samples. 
            <br>
            <p>The genres of Hip-Hop, House, French House, Electronica, and Jungle are a few examples of genres owing heavily to musical sampling.</p>

            <h2>Artists + Works</h2>
                <p><strong>Note:</strong> The lines of genre are not rigid. Many artists, especially those on this list, push and pull to create new and interesting sounds. Genre is not a gospel, but rather, a way for us to broadly define works. Often, works within genre, upon close inspection, will have more in difference than they do in similarity. In sample based music, the lines of genre are additionally blurred as they make use of pre-existing works. The first artist on the list, Kanye West, is famous for using Soul Samples from the 1970s. Is his music Soul? No, however, it may take some concepts from soul. That being said, here are a few artists and genres that make use of sampling. </p>
            <h3>Hip Hop</h3>
                    <p>The production of instrumental Hip-Hop includes playing samples and "scratching," using record players and the creating a rhythmic backing track, often using a drum machine or sequencer.</p>
                        <ul>
                    <li>Kanye West</li>
                    <li>J Dilla</li>

                        </ul>
            <h3>Dance</h3> 
                    <p>The production of dance music often includes sampled repetitive musical phrase, creating interest through groove, use of EQ, and "4 on the floor" drum patterns. </p>
